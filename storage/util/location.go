Package util contains utility functions for slot headers.

Packing and unpacking of slot sizes

The package contains functions to pack/unpack sizes for physical slots and
logical buckets. The size info is a 4 byte value which allocates 2 bytes
for current size and 2 bytes for available size.

	CCCC CCCC CCCC CCCC AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA

The allocated size value is a packed integer using a 2 bit multiplier
in the beginning - using these packed values a slot can grow up to
138681822 bytes (138 MB). The space allocation becomes more and more
wasteful with increasing slot size. The current size is stored as a
difference to the allocated size. The maximum difference between
alloacted and current space is 65534 bytes.

Packing and unpacking locations

The package contains utility functions to pack and unpack location information
in an uint64. A location is a pointer which identifies a specific record and
within the record a specific offset.

The 8 byte uint64 value is split into a 6 byte (48 bits) record address and
2 byte offset.

	RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR OOOO OOOO OOOO OOOO

We can address at maximum (having a record size of 32767 bytes):

(2^48 / 2 - 1) * 32767 = 4.61154528 * 10^18 which is around 4 exabyte

Considering a default page size of 4096 bytes we can address:

(2^48 / 2 - 1) * 4096 = 5.76460752 * 10^17 which is around 512 petabyte
